## Architecture

![mvvm](https://github.com/mertozseven/CryptoWatch/assets/75128197/b8afc54b-675f-40ac-abe1-87d4aeda153a)

In Gamesplorer's development, MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture is being used for these key reasons:

- **Enhanced Maintainability:**  MVVM facilitates a clean separation between the presentation logic and the business logic of the app. This separation makes it easier to manage and update the codebase as the app evolves.
- **Improved Testability:** The decoupling of the business logic from the UI components allows for more straightforward unit testing. Developers can focus on testing the logic behind the view model without worrying about the user interface.
- **Stronger Data Binding:** MVVM supports two-way data binding between the View and ViewModel, reducing the need for boilerplate code to synchronize the UI with the underlying data. This leads to less error-prone code and a smoother development process.
